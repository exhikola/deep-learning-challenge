# Data Processing:
Identified the target variable as "IS_SUCCESSFUL" for binary classification.
Used features like "APPLICATION_TYPE," "AFFILIATION," "CLASSIFICATION," "USE_CASE," "ORGANIZATION," "STATUS," "INCOME_AMT," and "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS."
Removed irrelevant variables like EIN and NAME.
Model Compilation, Training, and Evaluation:
Constructed a neural network model with 2 hidden layers, each with 4 neurons and ReLU activation, and an output layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation.
Despite efforts to optimize the model by adjusting the number of neurons and layers, the accuracy did not meet the target of 75%, achieving only around 72%.
Conclusion and Recommendations:
Acknowledged the limitations of the model and reflected on potential improvements.
Suggested increasing the number of neurons in the layers, such as trying 15, 20, or 50 neurons.
Proposed considering alternative classification approaches like Random Forest, which might capture more complex data interactions and potentially improve model performance.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Provide more details about the dataset, such as its size, the distribution of classes, and any preprocessing steps performed.
Consider exploring different activation functions, optimizer algorithms, and learning rates to fine-tune the model.
Implement techniques like regularization (e.g., dropout) to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search to find optimal model parameters.
Evaluate the model's performance using additional metrics besides accuracy, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, especially if the classes are imbalanced.
By incorporating these suggestions and continuing to experiment with different approaches, you may achieve better performance and gain deeper insights into the dataset.
